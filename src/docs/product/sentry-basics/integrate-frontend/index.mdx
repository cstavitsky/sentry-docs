This step-by-step tutorial walks you through the flow of setting up and configuring your Sentry account to monitor errors in a frontend application. After completing this tutorial, you can:

- Receive alerts when errors occur in your code
- Receive a readable stack trace with source code context
- Identify [suspect commits](https://docs.sentry.io/product/issues/suspect-commits/) likely to have introduced a particular error, and suggest assignees to resolve the issue

<Note>

We provided the source code for a sample React application to use along with this guide. By starting with the example app already in place, you can focus on learning how to instrument Sentry into your development workflow.

</Note>

Alternatively, you can follow this tutorial as a reference and apply the relevant changes directly to your source code.

## Prerequisites

- A [Sentry](https://sentry.io) account, or [sign up](https://sentry.io/signup/) for one
- A [GitHub](https://github.com/) account, or [sign up](https://github.com/join) for one (Our tutorial uses Github, but you can receive the same feature benefits from our [Bitbucket](https://docs.sentry.io/product/integrations/source-code-mgmt/bitbucket/) and [Gitlab](https://docs.sentry.io/product/integrations/source-code-mgmt/gitlab/) integrations).
